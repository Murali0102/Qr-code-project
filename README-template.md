- **Solution URL**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Murali0102/Qr-code-project.git)
- **Live Site URL**: [Live Site](https://murali0102.github.io/Qr-code-project/)

**Description of the solution**:
- The QR code component project is a simple and clean design featuring a QR code with a heading and brief text description. The layout is responsive, but on desktop view, some empty space can be noticed. To improve this, adding additional content about Frontend Mentor could enhance the overall experience. 
- As a beginner, this project was a good exercise to practice core web development concepts.

### Step 2: My process

3. **Built with**: 
   - HTML
   - CSS (Media Queries for responsiveness)
   - Flexbox for layout alignment
   - Semantic HTML5 tags

4. **What I learned**:
   - This project helped me learn basic HTML5 semantic tags and CSS media queries, which are essential for responsive design. I also learned how to structure a simple project and implement media queries for different screen sizes. As a beginner, this was an important step in understanding how the web works.

5. **Continued development**:
   - Going forward, I aim to write clean, optimized, and readable code. I will focus on improving my CSS skills and learning best practices for writing maintainable code.

6. **Useful resources**:
   - [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) – A great resource for learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) – Helpful for clarifying concepts and answering questions during the development process.
